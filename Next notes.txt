Next notes

1- To make unvisible route or make this folder can't be have route, you can use _ 
	EX; app/_components

2- To can child pages inhiret the title of layout, you can write the metadata with this way:
	export const metadata = {
		title: {
			template: '%s | The Wild Oasis',
			default: "Welcome | The Wild Oasis",
		},
	};

3- To make an icon behind the title in the top of browser tab, you can put the image into app folder and change name of this image to icon word.

4- We have steps to add custom font in layout page.

5- Image improve in homepage:
	<Image
        src={bg}
        fill
        placeholder="blur" // just work with the imported image not the src have a url of image
        alt="Mountains and forests with two cabins"
        className="object-cover object-top"
    />

6- You can build a nested layout to own nested routes, these example in accout folder.

7- You can use Suspence from react to loading just the fetch data to prevent make loading in all page (static + dynamic data), so this suspence will loading the data from backend
	<Suspense fallback={<Spinner/>}>
        <CabinList />
    </Suspense>
	it take the fallback component to be used.

8- To make dynamic metaData for dynamic routes: 
	export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
	const cabin = await getCabin(params.cabinId);
	console.log("cabin", cabin);
	return {title: `Cabin ${cabin.name}`}
	}	

	-> in the to before component name

9- When Nexy.JS switch to dynamic rendering
	1- The route has dynamic segment (page uses params)
	2- searchParams are used in the page component (/product?quentity=23)
	3- headers() or cookies() are used in any of the route's server components
	4- An uncached data request is made in any of the route's server component
